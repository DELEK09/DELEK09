I also enjoy music and play trumpet and piano. I like video games, having over 200 hours in Stardew Valley and playing my fair share in Minecraft, PokÃ©mon Violet, BotW and TotK as well as other games.
I am a cat person, I have two cats: Rudzia, a 10 year old female cat, and Felek, an 8 year old male.
